# Introduction

The purpose of this lab is to familiarize yourself with calculating degree centrality and degree centralization scores for undirected and directed networks in *R*. Please review the [Degree Centrality](https://jacobtnyoung.github.io/sna-textbook/ch-05-centrality-degree.html) chapter of the [SNA Textbook](https://jacobtnyoung.github.io/sna-textbook/index.html) and [Tutorial 5 - Degree Centrality and Centralization in R](../tutorials/tutorial-05-degree-centrality.html) prior to beginning this lab.    

<br>

## Part I: Working with an Undirected Network

For this part of the lab you will use data from [Thomas Grund and James Densley's study](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1043986214553377) of ties among members of an inner-city gang in London, England. The network is undirected, binary ties collected from anonymized arrests data. We will refer to this network as the `LondonGangNet`. Note that the object is of class `network`. To coerce the object to be an object of class `matrix`, use the `as.matrix()` function.

<br>

For the `LondonGangNet` network, do the following:  

1. Plot the network using the `gplot()` function.    
2. Calculate the degree for each actor.  
3. Calculate the standardized degree for each actor.  
4. Calculate the mean degree.  
5. Calculate the graph centralization for degree.  
6. Discuss the graph centralization score.   

<br>

## Part II: Working with a Directed Network

For this part of the lab you will use data from [Mangia Natarajan's study](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10940-006-9007-x) of a large cocaine trafficking organization in New York City. The network is directed, binary ties of communication between individuals collected from police wiretaps of 151 telephone conversations. We will refer to this network as the `CocaineDealingNet`. To coerce the object to be an object of class `matrix`, use the `as.matrix()` function.

<br>

For the `CocaineDealingNet` network, do the following:  

1. Plot the network using the `gplot()` function.    
2. Calculate the indegree and outdegree for each actor.  
3. Calculate the standardized indegree and outdegree for each actor.  
4. Calculate the mean indegree and outdegree.  
5. Compare the two means.  
6. Calculate the graph centralization for indegree and outdegree.  
7. Compare the two graph centralization scores.  

<br>

## Part III:

In [Lab 1](../labs/lab-01-instructions.html) you created two networks and in [Lab 2](../labs/lab-02-instructions.html) you imported, created a object of class network, and plotted the networks. I would like you to continue working with those networks for this part of the lab. 

Pick **one** of your networks and do the following:

  * If the network is *undirected*, repeat the steps in Part I.  
  
  * If the network is *directed*, repeat the steps in Part II.

# How to Submit

Download the [template for this lab](../labs/templates/lab-03-LastName.zip?raw=true) prior to beginning the lab. **The template contains code for accessing the data files**.

<br>

### Knitting to HTML

When you have completed your assignment, click the "Knit" button to render your `.RMD` file into a `.HTML` report.

<br>

### Special Instructions

Upload both your `.RMD` and `.HTML` files to the appropriate link for this assignment on the Canvas page for this course.

<br>

### Before You Submit

Remember to ensure the following before submitting your assignment.

1. Name your files using this format: **Lab-##-LastName.rmd** and **Lab-##-LastName.html**
2. Show both the solution for your code and write out your answers in the body text 

See [Google's R Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/Rguide.xml) for examples of common conventions.

<br>
<br>

### Common Knitting Issues

`.RMD` files are knit into `.HTML` and other formats procedural, or line-by-line.

* An error in code when knitting will halt the process; error messages will tell you the specific line with the error
* Certain functions like `install.packages()` or `setwd()` are bound to cause errors in knitting 
* Altering a dataset or variable in one chunk will affect their use in all later chunks
* If an object is "not found", make sure it was created or loaded with `library()` in a previous chunk

**If All Else Fails:** If you cannot determine and fix the errors in a code chunk that's preventing you from knitting your document, add `eval = FALSE` inside the brackets of `{r}` at the beginning of a chunk to ensure that R does not attempt to evaluate it, that is: `{r eval = FALSE}`. This will prevent an erroneous chunk of code from halting the knitting process.
